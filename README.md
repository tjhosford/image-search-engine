Image search engine via the Bing API.  I made this server for a side project so feel free to do whatever you please with it.

Example found at: http://tomhosford.com/image_search.html

(1) Set ENV['ACCOUNT_ID'] to your Azure Marketplace account key.
(2) `foreman start` to run the server
(3) pop open public/index.html and check out an example frontend locally
